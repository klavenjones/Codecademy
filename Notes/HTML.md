# HTML BASICS


A Typical Webpage is made up three of three separate layers that work together to deliver experience to the user. 


**Content Layer**

Information that you see on the webpage.
HTML or HyperText Markup Language provides the content layer and forms the structure of the web page. 

**Presentation layer**

Handles how the information looks. CSS or Cascading Style Sheets provides the presentation layer, and creates the visual styling of the web pages using things such as colors, typography, layout and much more. 

**Behavior layer**

Handles the user interaction of the page.
JavaScript handles the behavior layer. It provides interactivity to the layer.  i.e. Popups, rollovers, event handling. 


# HTML or Hypertext Markup Language 

Hypertext is any text that can be displayed on a computer screen and contains links to other texts, or hypertext documents. The web is a collection of billions of documents, interconnected by hyperlinks.

A markup language provides meaning to text in a document using instructions that describe how text should be structured, formatted, and laid out.

So, HTML is a markup language the browser uses to present information to users, like text, links, images, and videos. It's the basic component from which all websites an application on the web are built.

What is HTML?

HTML is the language used to create the websites you visit everyday. It provides a logical way to structure content for websites.

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.

A *markup language* is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text.  Markup languages work by surrounding raw text with information the computer can interpret, "marking it up" to be processed.

Computers can interpret raw text that is wrapped in HTML elements. These elements are often nested inside one another, with each containing information about the type and structure of the information to be displayed in the browser.

HyperText is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links, also known as “hyperlinks.”	



**HTML element**

HTML consists of a series of [*elements*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Element), which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way. The enclosing [tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tag) can make a bit of content into a hyperlink to link to another page on the web, italicize words, and so on. 

Here is the anatomy of an HTML element:

The Main parts of an element: 

1. **The opening tag**: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins, or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
1. **The closing tag**: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the end of the paragraph is. Failing to include a closing tag is one of the common beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
1. **The content:** This is the content of the element, which in this case is just text.
1. **The element:** The opening tag plus the closing tag plus the content equals the element.


Elements can also have [attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/attribute), which look like this:
